# comic_shop_project

Setting up the App:

Add a database called 'comic_shop'

Run the the db/seeds.rb file
Run the comics_controller.rb controller
Navigate through the different pages
All files for the project are shown in the relevant folders (models, views, public, etc.)

This App will allow you to keep track of stock and suppilers. 
It will let you create new stock and suppliers. (However all stock must have a supplier to be made)
It will track stock you have and highlight stock that is low and stock that has sold out
It will also tell you the mark in precntages of items of stock. 

Enjoy.
